# Online-Character-Recognition
A MATLAB GUI where the algorithm uses direction and slope to detect numbers in real time. This can easily extended to characters as well. You will need to input the number using the GUI.

The main file is :OnlineChar.m
Once you run the file, it will produce a dialogue to provide user input through the cursor (where the user should write any number from 0-9). To apply it to characters, just change the jpg images to the desired characters.
